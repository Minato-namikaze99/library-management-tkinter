# library-management-tkinter
-----------------------------INSTRUCTIONS---------------------------------
THIS PROGRAM HAS BEEN MADE BY INDRAJIT AND TANMOY OF CLASS 12A from
Kendriya Vidyalaya AFS Borjhar school.
Welcome !
We have made a simple python program of "Library Management System using
Tkinter"
Hope you guys like it....

Instructions to run the program :-

1. open command prompt with administrator access and then change the 
   directory to the "bin" file in the MySQL folder installed on your PC

   for e.g.,
   I have my bin folder in the follwoing directory
   "C:\wamp\bin\mysql\mysql5.0.51b\bin"

   so after opening command prompt, type the following
   "C:\Users\USER>cd C:\wamp\bin\mysql\mysql5.0.51b\bin"

   WARNING - My initial directory was "C:\Users\USER>", it 
             can be different in your PC.

   Now, for adding the sql file type the following (the command 
        prompt must not be closed)
   "mysql -u root -p[root_password] lib_management < lib_management.sql"

   WARNING - (i) The .sql file must be transferred to the "bin" folder
             (ii) In the place of "[root_password]", write your own 
                  SQL password, which you have given while it's 
                  installation.

2. My SQL password was 12589, so I have used it in my python code, if you 
   have a different password, kindly change the passwd in my python code
   so that it can run smoothly (sorry for the inconvienience of editing
   the password in python, I am really sorry...)
